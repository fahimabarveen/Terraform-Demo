Certainly! Let me provide a simplified explanation of the steps you've outlined:

1. **Create a Terraform Configuration File (main.tf):**
   - You've defined a Terraform configuration in a file named `main.tf`.
   - This configuration specifies that you're using the `azurerm` provider from HashiCorp.
   - You've also defined a resource group named "example-resources" in the "East US" Azure region.

2. **Authenticate to Azure:**
   - To create infrastructure, Terraform needs to authenticate with Azure.
   - You can use the Azure CLI to set up your account permissions locally.
   - Run `az login` to log in to your Azure account.
   - Set the subscription context using `az account set --subscription "35akss-subscription-id"`.

3. **Initialize Your Terraform Configuration:**
   - Run `terraform init` in your terminal to initialize your Terraform project.
   - This command sets up necessary dependencies and plugins.

4. **Format and Validate Configuration:**
   - Consistent formatting is essential for readability.
   - Run `terraform fmt` to automatically format your configuration files.

5. **Apply Your Terraform Configuration:**
   - Execute `terraform apply` to create the specified resources.
   - Terraform will create the resource group based on your configuration.

6. **Inspect Your State:**
   - After applying the configuration, Terraform maintains a state file (`terraform.tfstate`).
   - This file contains information about the created resources.
   - Use `terraform show` and `terraform state list` to inspect the state.
