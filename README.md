# Terraform-Demo
Terraform is an open-source tool that allows you to define your infrastructure as code. With Terraform, you can build, modify, and version infrastructure efficiently and safely. It works with both low-level components (such as compute instances, storage, and networking) and high-level components (like DNS entries and SaaS features) in various cloud environments1. If you have any specific questions or need further details, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€

In Terraform, the main.tf file serves as the starting point for implementing your infrastructure as code. Hereâ€™s what you need to know about it:

**Purpose of main.tf:**
